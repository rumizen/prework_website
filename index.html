  	<p>It was just three years ago that I considered my phone my <span class= "bold">only camera</span>. Three years ago that I started making enough money to travel. Three years ago that I went skiing in Colorado for the first time and caught a frigid view of the Rockies at 12,000ft. My first camera was purchased before I flew home to Boston--eager to capture the magnificence of the great mountains. Very quickly, I was hit with a few things that every budding photographer learns in the beginning:</p>
  	<div id="introList">
  	<ul>
  	  <li>Cameras don't make great photos. Photographers do.</li>
  	  <li>I am not going to get 10,000 followers on Instagram.</li>
  	  <li>I need all of the lenses but I only have two kidneys.</li>
  	</ul>
    </div>
  	<p>Cut to present day--I'm here with both kidneys and a few more IG followers. But what I really have to show for myself from this journey are the stories; Both in the form of .jpeg and in the form of human memories. I've flown, driven, hiked, and climbed my way to some of the most beautiful locales in the world (often in the wee hours of the night), just to create the perfect image. When I look at these photos now, sometimes<span class= "italic"> years after</span> the moment they were captured, I can still feel the biting wind on my hands, the smell of the pines that I sat under, or the shared delight of a perfect sunrise with the fellow photographer a few yards away. I'm now going to take you on a whirlwind tour of my favorite images and how they were made!</p>

      <p>The four hour drive from Denver to Moab is an experience in and of itself, but the Utah National Parks are the true prize. I spent a cold day scouting locations and calculating the perfect angle and the perfect time. After trudging to my spot in the pre-sunrise darkness, I was welcomed by a group of 15 other tourists with tripods set up inches from each other. I had to skirt the wall of photographers and move to the far left of the archway-view, giving me a different perspective than the others. To my delight, the sun popped its head into the tiny sliver of space between the arch and the horizon. This created the sharp rays of light that ended up making the image so special.</p>

      <h3 id="h3left">Sand Dunes National Park</h3>
      <p id="textLeft">When you think of Colorado, you think of white-capped peaks and massive evergreen trees. And that's exactly why the Great Sand Dunes Nation Park is one of the most surreal locations in the state. It teleports you to another world--a world where no cavity in your body is safe from hot sand. It took immense effort to climb the ever-shifting dunes, but the payoff was unforgettable. As I stodd at the top of one these ridges, I noticed the silhouette of a man by himself wuite a distance away. He ended up taking a moment to soak it all in just as I snapped what is now my favorite image I've ever captured.</p>

  	  <h3 id="h3right">16th Street Mall, Denver</h3>
      <p id="textRight">Urban adventures tend to be noisier and smellier, but I've always loved how cities come alive at night. I used to work in an office downtown and I would stroll 16th Street Mall almost daily in search of a decent lunch. After scouting out a composition one day, I decided to come back that night with my camera. After setting up with the clock tower in the background, I realized that the regular buses could make  unique light trails in a long exposure. Getting the timing right was difficult, but I finally caught a bus with a perfectly timed shutter. This shot evokes a sci-fi vibe that I've always wanted to create!</p>
